            <p><a href="https://dtpintro.weebly.com/parc.html">Proximity is used to group the links on the navigation
                  bar</a></p>
            <img src="./images/proximity.jpeg" alt="Image of messed up words" class="column-image">
            <p>Items relating to each other should be grouped close together. When several items are in close proximity
               to each other, they become one visual unit rather than several separate units.</p>
            <p>Group related items together. Use spacing to convey visually what information is related. Bits of
               information that are not related should not be in close proximity to other bits on the page.</p>

            <h2 class="subheader">Alignment</h2>
            <p><a href="https://rhetoricrevealed.wordpress.com/about/alignment/">One will find that the two girls are
                  aligned one after another</a></p>
            <img src="./images/alignment.jpeg" alt="Image of 2 girls aligned." class="column-image">
            <p>At first glance, there might not seem to be any sort of observable alignment, other than the text at the
               top aligning with the bottom text. </p>
            <p>Nevertheless, with a scrupulous eye, one will find that the two girls are aligned, along with the flag
               and rocking chair behind the girls. </p>
            <!-- <p>The second way contrast is used on this page is through the use of white text on a colored background. This negative space creates contrast from complex background, leading your eye to focus on and read the text. By using the difference in complexity, the website is able to communicate it's message of statistic driven marketing.</p> -->

            <h2 class="subheader">Rule of third</h2>
            <p><a href="https://digital-photography-school.com/rule-of-thirds/">Okay, but what in the world does the
                  Rule of Thirds mean?</a></p>
            <img src="./images/rule-of-thirds.jpeg" alt="Image of messed up words in a browser." class="column-image">
            <p>The basic principle behind the rule of thirds is to imagine breaking an image down into thirds (both
               horizontally and vertically) so that you have 9 parts. </p>
            <p>The theory is that if you place points of interest in the intersections or along the lines that your
               photo becomes more balanced and will enable a viewer of the image to interact with it more naturally.</p>
